# Parse

The parse endpoint allows you to extract text content from various document formats, including PDFs.

## Endpoint Overview

- **URL**: `/v1/parse`
- **Method**: POST
- **Content-Type**: multipart/form-data

## Request Parameters

| Name            | Type   | Required | Description                   |
| --------------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| x-authorization | string | Yes      | Your API key (Bearer token)   |
| file            | file   | Yes      | The file to extract text from |

## How to Use

1. Include your API key in the `x-authorization` header
2. Provide the file you want to extract text from in the `file` parameter

## Python Example

Here's a Python script demonstrating the API usage:

```python
import requests
import os

# Configuration
api_key = "your_api_key_here"
api_url = "https://api.panda-etl.ai/v1/parse"
file_path = "path/to/your/document.pdf"

# Prepare the request
headers = {
    "x-authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"
}

files = {
    "file": (os.path.basename(file_path), open(file_path, "rb"))
}

# Send request and handle response
response = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers, files=files, timeout=360)

if response.status_code in [200, 201]:
    result = response.json()
    print("Text extraction successful:")
    print(result)
else:
    print(f"Error {response.status_code}: {response.text}")
```

This script showcases:

1. Setting up the request with the API key
2. Opening and sending the file for text extraction
3. Sending the POST request
4. Handling the API response

Remember to replace `"your_api_key_here"` with your actual API key and `"path/to/your/document.pdf"` with the path to the file you want to process.

## Response

A successful response will have a status code of 200 or 201 and a JSON body containing the extracted text. The exact format of the response may vary depending on the document type and content.

## Error Handling

The API may return the following error responses:

- 400: Bad Request (e.g., invalid input or processing error)
- 500: Internal Server Error

Always check the response status code and handle errors appropriately in your application.

## Best Practices

- Ensure your files are in a supported format (e.g., PDF, DOCX)
- Keep file sizes reasonable to avoid timeouts or processing issues
- Implement proper error handling, especially for large-scale processing
- Use appropriate retry mechanisms in production environments
