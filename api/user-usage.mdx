# User Usage

The User Usage endpoint allows you to retrieve information about your API usage, including credit consumption and limits.

## Endpoint Overview

- **URL**: `/v1/user/usage`
- **Method**: POST
- **Content-Type**: application/json

## Request Parameters

| Name            | Type   | Required | Description                 |
| --------------- | ------ | -------- | --------------------------- |
| x-authorization | string | Yes      | Your API key (Bearer token) |

## How to Use

1. Include your API key in the `x-authorization` header
2. Send a POST request to the endpoint

## Python Example

Here's a Python script demonstrating the API usage:

```python
import requests

# Configuration
api_key = "your_api_key_here"
api_url = "https://api.panda-etl.ai/v1/user/usage"

# Prepare the request
headers = {
    "x-authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"
}

# Send request and handle response
response = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers)

if response.status_code in [200, 201]:
    usage_data = response.json()
    print("Usage data retrieved successfully:")
    print(usage_data)
else:
    print(f"Error {response.status_code}: {response.text}")
```

This script showcases:

1. Setting up the request with the API key
2. Sending the POST request to retrieve usage data
3. Handling the API response

Remember to replace `"your_api_key_here"` with your actual API key.

## Response

A successful response will have a status code of 200 or 201 and a JSON body containing your usage data. The response includes the following information:

- `credits_used`: The number of credits you have used
- `total_credits`: Your total credit limit

Example response:

```json
{
  "credits_used": 800,
  "total_credits": 1000
}
```

## Interpreting the Response

You can use this information to determine your current credit usage and remaining balance:

1. **Credits Used**: The `credits_used` field shows how many credits you have consumed.
2. **Total Credits**: The `total_credits` field represents your credit limit.
3. **Remaining Credits**: You can calculate your remaining credits by subtracting `credits_used` from `total_credits`.

For example, if you want to check if you've reached your credit limit, you can use the following logic:

```python
if usage_data["credits_used"] >= usage_data["total_credits"]:
    print("You have reached or exceeded your credit limit.")
else:
    remaining_credits = usage_data["total_credits"] - usage_data["credits_used"]
    print(f"You have {remaining_credits} credits remaining.")
```

## Error Handling

The API may return the following error responses:

- 400: Bad Request
- 401: Unauthorized (invalid API key)
- 500: Internal Server Error

Always check the response status code and handle errors appropriately in your application.

## Best Practices

- Regularly check your usage to avoid unexpected service interruptions
- Monitor your credit usage and set up alerts if you're approaching your limit
- Use this endpoint to implement usage-based features or restrictions in your application
- Consider requesting a credit limit increase if you consistently approach your limit
